# Applied Data Science Capstone Project

This repository contains my final project for the **Applied Data Science Capstone** course on Coursera, offered by **IBM**.

## 📌 Project Purpose

This project was completed as part of my journey to learn and practice how **end-to-end Data Science workflows** are carried out — from data collection and cleaning, to model building, evaluation, and selecting the best performing solution.

As a learner, my goal was to understand how all the different steps of a data science project come together in a real-world context.

## 🚀 What I Learned

- Data preparation and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Applying machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN)  
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV  
- Evaluating and comparing model performance  
- Making data-driven decisions

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebooks  

## 📚 Course Info

This project is part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificat** on **Coursera**.
